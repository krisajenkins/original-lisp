# Original Lisp

The original Lisp function, written in clojure.

## Usage

See the test cases, and particularly the paul-graham-examples tests, for a demo.

## About

In 1960 John McCarthy published the snappily-titled, ["Recursive Functions of
Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I"][recursive_functions]. This paper
contained a description of Turning-Equivalent program evaluator based on
processing lists of symbols.

Soonafter, Steve Russull realize that the theory could be realized on an IBM
704, and bang! Lisp was born.

In 2001 Paul Graham wrote a [paper][roots_lisp] that digested McCarthy's work for a geek audience.

On 19th November 2012, we^ re-implemented the original Lisp function in Clojure, as part of the [London Clojurians][ldnclj] Code Dojo.
